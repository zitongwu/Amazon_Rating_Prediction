So I am glad this one did.  Olive oil doesn't get better with age, so I want to know if it's fresh. Also, there are no food allergens in this oil.  Believe it or not I found out by accident that some olive oils are made in a facility, sometimes using shared equipment, with food allergens such as soy, dairy, and nuts to name a few.  I cannot use it bc of this bc my 7-yr-old g'daughter is allergic.  When I order EVOO, it is an expectation that it is safe to use. I order EVOO online expecting it to be 'pure' and free of dangerous allergens, only to find that in a few rare instances, that there are brands of oil that I have to steer clear of and they do not state the presence of allergens at point of purchase. So luckily, this olive oil is free from food allergens.\n\nIn short, yes, it is the taste of the oil that is important, but to me, so too is freshness and even moreso, safety.  I love Olio Santo brand garlic EVOO, from Wms-Sonoma, but you can't always find it from them or even here on Amazon, so I am in the searching phase of finding another good brand of garlic EVOO to fall back on.

With the Habanero flakes you don't have as high a chance of getting 'hot spots', places that get a few flakes where other bites had no flakes.  That happens with the Ghost Peppers.

The sauce is thin and doesn't have a lot of flavor.  Luckily, a hefty sprinkle of parmesan cheese helped doctor it up.  I think it would be very good with the addition of some fresh mushrooms, olives, etc.  I would probably add some good crushed tomatoes to give it more tomato flavor.
